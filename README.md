# subsim
subsim is a little website providing various calculations and training methods for submarine simulators.

## Contributions welcome
This is my first real HTML/JS project, normally I wrote mostly backend code and rarely touch frontend stuff.
Contributions are definitely welcome, I am sure I can learn a lot.
